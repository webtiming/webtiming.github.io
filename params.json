Timing has many purposes such as correct time ordering, delay, concurrency/synchronization, periodicity, or perhaps rate adjustments in progress or processing.\r\n\r\nOf course, the Web already has several mechanisms supporting timed operations. Most famously _setTimeout_ and _setInterval_ allow fairly precise timed execution of JavaScript and is the basis for timed animations. The _HTML5MediaElement_ also counts as timing mechanism, as it provides timed presentation of continuous media and playback controls. Similarly, the _HTMLTrackElement_ offers time alignment of subtitles and chapter information. _WebAnimations_ is a framework for animations with playback control.  \r\n\r\nHowever, the Web lacks support for multi-device timing. All the timing mechanisms above are limited in scope to a single Web page. In contrast, a multi-device timing mechanism would allow timed operations across Web pages hosted by different devices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
