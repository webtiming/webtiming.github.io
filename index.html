<p>Timing mechanisms allow operations to be executed at the correct time. Timing has many purposes such as correct time ordering, delay, concurrency/synchronization, periodicity, or perhaps rate adjustments in progress or processing.</p>

<p>Of course, the Web already has several mechanisms supporting timed operations. Most famously <em>setTimeout</em> and <em>setInterval</em> allow fairly precise timed execution of JavaScript and is the basis for timed animations. The HTML5MediaElement also counts as timing mechanism, as it provides timed presentation of continuous media and playback controls. Similarly, the HTMLTrackElement offers time alignment of subtitles and chapter information. WebAnimations is a framework for animations with playback control.  </p>

<p>However, the Web lacks support for multi-device timing. All the timing mechanisms above are limited in scope to a single Web page. In contrast, a multi-device timing mechanism would allow timed operations across Web pages hosted by different devices.</p>
