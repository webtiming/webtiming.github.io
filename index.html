<p>Timing mechanisms allow operations to be executed at the correct time. Timing has many purposes such as correct time ordering, delay, concurrency/synchronization, periodicity, or perhaps rate adjustments in progress or processing.</p>

<p>Of course, the Web already has several mechanisms supporting timed operations. Most famously <em>setTimeout</em> and <em>setInterval</em> allow fairly precise timed execution of JavaScript and is the basis for timed animations. The <em>HTML5MediaElement</em> also counts as timing mechanism, as it provides timed presentation of continuous media and playback controls. Similarly, the <em>HTMLTrackElement</em> offers time alignment of subtitles and chapter information. <em>WebAnimations</em> is a framework for animations with playback control.  </p>

<p>However, the Web lacks support for multi-device timing. All the timing mechanisms above are limited in scope to a single Web page. In contrast, a multi-device timing mechanism would allow timed operations across Web pages hosted by different devices.</p>
